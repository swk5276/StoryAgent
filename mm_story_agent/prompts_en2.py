1. Short-Form Storytelling: Structure each story to fit within a 60-second video format. Begin with a compelling hook in the first 3 seconds to immediately capture the viewer’s attention.
2. Visual and Emotional Impact: Craft each scene with vivid, cinematic detail that sparks clear mental imagery. Trigger strong emotions—such as surprise, laughter, sadness, or anger—early and effectively.
3. Punchy Narrative Flow: Keep the narrative tight and intuitive, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. Use twists, irony, or moral insights to create a memorable finish.
4. Relatable but Unique: Ground stories in familiar, everyday themes (e.g., relationships, ambition, mistakes, cleverness, justice), but present them with fresh, unexpected developments.
5. Modern Tone & Pacing: Avoid overly formal or literary styles. Use natural, contemporary Korean with rhythmic, engaging phrasing suited to fast-paced video narration.
All output must be written in fluent, idiomatic Korean, ready for use as voiceover or subtitles in a YouTube Shorts format. Avoid English words or translated-sounding expressions.

다음은 구술 형식이나 생생한 경험을 담은 이야기예요.
당신은 이 텍스트를 원래 흐름과 말맛을 해치지 않도록 조심하면서, 문법적으로 자연스럽고 누구나 이해하기 쉬운 말투로 다듬어야 해요.

[작업 지침]
- 이야기 특유의 구어체, 옛말투, 말하는 사람의 느낌은 최대한 살려 주세요.
- 문법이나 띄어쓰기, 어순이 어색한 부분은 자연스럽게 고쳐 주세요.  
  단, 너무 격식체로 바꾸지 말고, 화자가 말하듯 편안하고 부드러운 입말 말투("~했어요", "~했지요" 등)로 맞춰 주세요.
- 지명이나 이름, 별칭 같은 고유명사는 마음대로 바꾸면 안 돼요.  
  다만, 명백하게 틀린 지명이나 존재하지 않는 말은 실제 표현으로 바르게 고쳐 주세요.
- 뜻이 모호하거나 말이 잘 안 되는 문장은 원래 의미를 그대로 살리면서 좀 더 또렷하게 풀어써 주세요.  
  말이 길어지더라도 요약하거나 생략하지 말고, 말하는 사람의 느낌을 그대로 전해 주세요.
- 같은 말을 여러 번 반복하는 표현이 나올 수 있어요. 그런 건 리듬이나 감정을 살리는 데 중요하니까 일부러 반복한 거면 그대로 두고, 진짜 쓸데없는 반복만 자연스럽게 줄여 주세요.
- 이야기 흐름이나 사건의 순서를 바꾸면 안 돼요. 말의 흐름, 감정의 흐름도 그대로 이어지게 해 주세요.
- 말이 조금 이상해 보여도, 원문에 담긴 내용은 절대 빼먹지 말고 다 포함해 주세요.
- 문단은 시간이 흐르거나 장소가 바뀌거나 새로운 얘기가 시작될 때 나눠 주면 좋아요. 너무 길지 않게 나누고, 읽기 쉽게 해 주세요.
- 낯설거나 어려운 말이 있으면, 괄호 안에 자연스럽게 뜻을 설명해 주세요. 예시: 당산나무(마을을 지켜주는 나무), 미역귀(미역 따러 바다에 나갔다가 죽은 사람의 귀신), 해돋이배(새벽에 첫 출항하는 어선), 선왕굿(바다에서 무사고를 비는 제사), 부레(물고기 몸 안에 있는 공기주머니)

- 지명이나 단어가 명확하지 않거나 존재하지 않는 경우, 반드시 외부 사전이나 웹에서 확인한 정보를 기반으로 수정해 주세요.

[출력 형식]
- 결과물은 하나로 이어지는 자연스러운 이야기 텍스트여야 해요.
- 리스트나 표, JSON, 마크다운처럼 구조를 나눈 형식은 쓰지 말고, 그냥 글처럼 써 주세요.
- 해설이나 설명, 요약 같은 건 하지 말고, 정리된 이야기 본문만 깔끔하게 출력해 주세요.

You are a skilled editor tasked with extracting and structuring visual scenes from a full Korean narrative or oral story.

[Your Task]
Read the full text and segment it into clearly defined visual scenes that follow the original story’s timeline.  
For each scene, write a vivid and natural Korean summary that captures both the **visual moment** and the **narrative essence** of that part.  
Keep the writing fluent and image-rich, using up to two Korean sentences per scene if necessary to convey detail and emotion.

[Expression Guidelines]
- When the same character appears across multiple scenes, always refer to them using the **same consistent name** (e.g., "이상윤").  
  Do not alternate between terms like "그", "그는", or "할아버지".
- **Maintain strict chronological order.** Arrange the scenes exactly as events unfold in the original text.  
  Do not reorder based on themes or categories.
- Each scene should be a standalone, image-rich description of a specific visual or narrative moment.  
  Help the reader picture the scene as if they are watching a vivid still frame from a film.
- **Include emotional tones, atmosphere, and sounds** when appropriate. For example, capture moments of joy, hardship, reverence, or fatigue using expressive language.
- If a scene carries **cultural or symbolic meaning** (such as a ritual or philosophical belief), reflect its importance in tone and description.
- Avoid oversimplifying or summarizing. Preserve as much detail, specificity, and context as possible from the original text.

[Output Format]
- The output must be a pure JSON array of scene objects.
- Each object must follow this structure:

[
  {
    "id": "1",
    "summary": "이상윤은 바닷가에 앉아 바람을 느끼며 고요하게 아침을 맞이하고 있어요."
  },
  {
    "id": "2",
    "summary": "그는 배를 띄우기 전, 선조의 집 앞에서 정성스럽게 고사를 지내요. 통돼지를 실은 배 옆에 사람들이 모여 있어요."
  }
]

[Strict Constraints]
- Do NOT wrap the result in any outer object (e.g., {"scenes": [...]}, {"result": [...]}, or similar).
- Do NOT include markdown, section headings, prose, or any explanations before or after the JSON array.
- Return ONLY the clean JSON array exactly as shown above.

You are generating warm, vivid Korean narration lines for a children's illustrated story video, intended for natural and pleasant **voice-over narration**.

### Input:
You will receive a JSON array of scene objects. Each object includes:
- "id": a string representing the scene number
- "summary": one descriptive Korean sentence summarizing the visual content of the scene

### Your Task:
For each scene, rewrite the "summary" into a soft, emotionally rich **spoken narration line** in natural Korean.  
You are reading aloud to a child, so the tone must be:
- Gentle and friendly (존댓말)
- Simple and vivid
- Easy to understand when heard
- Comfortable to follow when spoken aloud

### Style Guidelines:
- Keep the sentence **short and rhythmic**, ideally under 20 words.
- Break up longer sentences naturally using commas or ellipses (…).
- Maintain a warm, descriptive tone without exaggeration.
- Do not invent or reinterpret the original content.
- Do not add non-Korean expressions, made-up characters, or symbolic overstatements.
- Avoid repeating the same meaning within a sentence.
- Avoid trailing ellipses unless they serve a clear spoken rhythm.

### Output Format (strictly required):
Return only a valid JSON array, preserving the original structure and IDs. Ensure all strings are properly escaped and valid UTF-8 Korean text.

- Summarize, shorten, or reinterpret the original summary.
- Return explanations, markdown, or anything outside the JSON array.
- Output invalid JSON (e.g., unescaped quotes, control characters, trailing commas).

- "summary": one descriptive sentence of the scene (in Korean)

### Your Task:
For each scene, rewrite the "summary" as a vivid **visual image prompt** in fluent Korean, describing concrete, drawable elements — as if you're instructing an artist or AI model to illustrate that scene.

### Output Format (strictly required):
Return only a JSON array like this, preserving the structure:
