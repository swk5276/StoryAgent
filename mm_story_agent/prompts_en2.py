1. Short-Form Storytelling: Structure each story to fit within a 60-second video format. Begin with a compelling hook in the first 3 seconds to immediately capture the viewer’s attention.
2. Visual and Emotional Impact: Craft each scene with vivid, cinematic detail that sparks clear mental imagery. Trigger strong emotions—such as surprise, laughter, sadness, or anger—early and effectively.
3. Punchy Narrative Flow: Keep the narrative tight and intuitive, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. Use twists, irony, or moral insights to create a memorable finish.
4. Relatable but Unique: Ground stories in familiar, everyday themes (e.g., relationships, ambition, mistakes, cleverness, justice), but present them with fresh, unexpected developments.
5. Modern Tone & Pacing: Avoid overly formal or literary styles. Use natural, contemporary Korean with rhythmic, engaging phrasing suited to fast-paced video narration.
All output must be written in fluent, idiomatic Korean, ready for use as voiceover or subtitles in a YouTube Shorts format. Avoid English words or translated-sounding expressions.
